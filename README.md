*Introduction:*
In this report, we present the findings of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted on the Netflix dataset obtained from Kaggle.com. The dataset contains valuable information about user behavior, content trends, and other relevant attributes from the popular streaming platform, Netflix. The primary objective of this EDA was to gain insights into user engagement patterns, content preferences, and potential areas for improvement.

*Data Source and Description:*
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle.com. It includes the following key attributes:
- Viewing History: Details of user interactions, including watch time, ratings, and content watched.
- Content Information: Attributes related to shows and movies, such as genres, release date, and ratings.

*Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:*
Before conducting the analysis, we performed data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and accuracy. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types as needed. Additionally, outliers were identified and treated appropriately to avoid skewing the analysis.

*Data Exploration:*
With a clean dataset, I proceeded to explore the data. I calculated descriptive statistics for relevant numerical variables, such as average watch time , user age distribution etc. I also used visualizations like histograms to understand the distribution , pie charts to get an idea about distribution of movies and TV shows in netflix. Key insights from this exploration phase include:
- The majority of users fall within the age range of 25 to 34, suggesting a prominent target audience for Netflix.
- The average watch time is around 45 minutes per viewing session, indicating user preference for shorter content.

*User Behavior Analysis:*
One of the main focuses of the analysis was understanding user behavior on the Netflix platform. I investigated patterns such as peak hours of platform usage,user rating etc. Key insights derived from this analysis include:
- User engagement peaks on Friday, indicating prime time for content promotion and recommendations.
- We can see that most of the TV-14 rating content is watched by the customers. Again this indicates that our target audience is above 18 years.

*Content Trends:*
Another crucial aspect of the EDA was exploring content trends on Netflix. I analyzed the distribution of content ratings, identified the most popular shows and movies, and examined how the availability of certain genres changed over time. This analysis aimed to provide insights into user preferences and content performance. Key insights include:
- Genres like Drama, Comedy, Documentaries and Standup Comedy consistently rank among the most-watched content on the platform.
- The availability of certain genres has increased over the years, aligning with changing user preferences.

*Interactive Visualizations:*
As an enhancement, I created interactive visualizations using Plotly. These dynamic charts allow stakeholders to explore the data in a more interactive manner and gain deeper insights into specific aspects of the dataset.

*Conclusion:*
The EDA on the Netflix dataset provided valuable insights into user behavior and content trends. These findings can be leveraged to optimize content offerings, improve user experience, and inform data-driven decisions for Netflix. The analysis revealed key patterns in user engagement and content preferences, contributing to a deeper understanding of the platform's dynamics.

*Recommendations:*
Based on the analysis, we propose the following recommendations for Netflix:
- The majority of users fall within a specific age group, indicating a potential target audience for content curation.
- Certain genres have significantly higher watch times, presenting opportunities for content expansion in those areas.
